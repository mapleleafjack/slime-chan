## Troubleshooting

### Chat doesn't appear
**Cause**: Slime not properly selected
**Fix**: Look for white circle indicator

### Can't type
**Cause**: Slime is thinking or not selected
**Fix**: Wait for response or re-select slime

### No AI responses
**Cause**: API not configured
**Fix**: Check settings (⚙️) for green "● Configured"

### Responses are random
**Cause**: Using fallback mode
**Fix**: Console will show `ℹ️ AI not configured`

## Summary

The chat feature transforms Slime-chan from a passive pet viewer into an interactive conversational experience. Users can now:

1. **Select slimes** with a click
2. **Type messages** in an intuitive chat box
3. **See AI at work** with clear visual feedback
4. **Get contextual responses** that match slime personality
5. **Understand what's happening** with console logs

All while maintaining backward compatibility with the fallback system!
